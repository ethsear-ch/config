-# Nutch Change Log
-
-Nutch 1.16 Release 02/10/2019 (dd/mm/yyyy)
-Release Report: https://s.apache.org/l2j94
-
-Comments
-
-    -  schema.xml has been moved to indexer-solr plugin directory. This file is provided as a
-       reference/guide for Solr users (NUTCH-2654)
-
-Breaking Changes
-
-    -  The value of crawl.gen.delay is now read in milliseconds as stated in the description
-       in nutch-default.xml. Previously, the value has been read in days, see NUTCH-1842 for
-       further information.
-
-    -  HostDB entries have been moved from Integer to Long in order to accomodate very large
-       hosts. Remove your existing HostDB and recreate it with bin/nutch updatehostdb, see
-       NUTCH-2694 for additional information.
-
-    -  The signature class TextProfileSignature has been improved to be stable over
-       consecutive runs by sorting tokens by frequency first and secondarily in lexicographic
-       order.  If an existing CrawlDb contains signatures generated by TextProfileSignature
-       these are likely to change when upgrading to Nutch 1.16.  The previous behavior relying
-       on a semi-stable pseudo-random hash sorting could be restored setting the property
-       `db.signature.text_profile.sec_sort_lex` to `false`. See also NUTCH-2381.

-    (Eelco Lempsink via ab)
-
- 4. NUTCH-456 - Parse msexcel plugin speedup (Heiko Dietze via siren)
-
- 5. NUTCH-446 - RobotRulesParser should ignore Crawl-delay values of other
-    bots in robots.txt (Dogacan Guney via siren)
-
- 6. NUTCH-482 - Remove redundant plugin lib-log4j (siren)

-12. NUTCH-443 - allow parsers to return multiple Parse object, this will speed 
-    up the rss parser (dogacan via mattmann). This update is a fix and semantics
-    change from the original patch for NUTCH-443. The original patch did not tell
-    the  Indexer to read crawl_parse too so that it can pickup sub-urls' fetch 
-    datums. This patch addresses that issue. Now, if Fetcher gets a null content, 
-    instead of pushing an empty content, it filters the null content.
-    
-13. NUTCH-485 - Change HtmlParseFilter 's to return ParseResult object instead of

-16. NUTCH-444 Possibly use a different library to parse RSS feed for improved 
-    performance and compatibility. This patch introduced a new plugin, feed,
-    that includes an index filter and a parse plugin for feeds that uses ROME.
-    There was discussion to remove parse-rss, in light of the feed plugin, 
-    however, this patch does not explicitly remove parse-rss. (dogacan, mattmann)

-
-32. NUTCH-518 - Fix OpicScoringFilter to respect scoring filter chaining.
-    (Enis Soztutar via dogacan)
-
-33. NUTCH-516 - Next fetch time is not set when it is a 
-    CrawlDatum.STATUS_FETCH_GONE. (Emmanuel Joke via dogacan)
-
-34. NUTCH-525 - DeleteDuplicates generates ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
-    when trying to rerun dedup on a segment. (Vishal Shah via dogacan)
-
-35. NUTCH-514 - Indexer should only index pages with fetch status SUCCESS.

-
-Release 0.7 - 2005-08-17
-
- 1. Added support for "type:" in queries. Search results are limited/qualified
-    by mimetype or its primary type or sub type. For example,
-    (1) searching with "type:application/pdf" restricts results
-    to pages which were identified to be of mimetype "application/pdf".
-    (2) with "type:application", nutch will return pages of
-    primary type "application".
-    (3) with "type:pdf", only pages of sub type "pdf" will be listed.
-    (John Xing, 20050120)
-
- 2. Added support for "date:" in queries. Last-Modified is indexed.
-    Search results are restricted by lower and upper date (inclusive)
-    as date:yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd. For example, date:20040101-20041231
-    only returns pages with Last-Modified in year 2004.
-    (John Xing, 20050122)
-
- 3. Add URLFilter plugin interface and convert existing url filters into
-    plugins. (John Xing, 20050206)
-
- 4. Add UpdateSegmentsFromDb tool, which updates the scores and
-    anchors of existing segments with the current values in the web
-    db.  This is used by CrawlTool, so that pages are now only fetched
-    once per crawl.  (Doug Cutting, 20050221)
-
- 5. Moved code into org.apache.nutch sub-packages.  Changed license to
-    Apache 2.0.  Removed jar files whose licenses do not permit
-    redistribution by Apache.  Disabled compilation of plugins which
-    require these libraries.  (Doug Cutting 20050301)
-
- 6. Index host and title in separate fields.  Host was indexed
-    previously only as a part of the URL.  Title was indexed as an
-    anchor.  Now boosts for matching these fields may be adjusted
-    separately from boosts for matching anchors and url.  Also: move
-    site indexing to index-basic plugin to minimize the number of
-    times the URL needs to be parsed; and, stop using anchor analyzer
-    for anything but anchors.  (Piotr Kosiorowski via Doug Cutting
-    20050323)
-
- 7. Add servlet Cached.java that serves cached Content of any mime type.
-    Slightly modified are web.xml and cached.jsp.
-    (John Xing, 20050401)
-
- 8. Add skipCompressedByteArray() to WritableUtils.java.
-    (John Xing, 20050402)
-
- 9. Fixes to jsp and static web pages.  These now use relative links,
-    so that the Nutch webapp file can be used in places other than at
-    the root.  Also fixed links to the about and help pages.  Bug #32.
-    (Jerome Charron via cutting, 20050404)
-
-10. Added some features to DistributedSearch: new segments can be added
-    to searchservers without restarting the frontend, defective search
-    servers are not queried until tey come back online, watchdog keeps
-    an eye for your searchservers and writes simple statistics.
-    (Sami Siren, 20050407)
-    
-11. Fix for bug #4 - Unbalanced quote in query eats all resources.
-	(Piotr Kosiorowski, Sami Siren, 20050407)
-
-12. Close Issue #33 - MIME content type detector (using magic char sequences).
-    (Jerome Charron and Hari Kodungallur via John Xing, 20050416)
-
-13. Add a servlet that implements A9's OpenSearch RSS web service.
-    (cutting, 20050418)
-
-14. Remove references to link analysis from tutorial, and enable
-    scoring by link count when generating fetchlists and searching.
-    (cutting, 20040419)
-
-15. Make query boosts for host, title, anchor and phrase matches
-    configurable.  (Piotr Kosiorowski via cutting, 20050419)
-
-16. Add support for sorting search results and search-time deduping by
-    fields other than site.
-
-17. Automatically convert range queries into cached range filters.
-    This improves the performance and scalability of, e.g., date range
-    searching.
-
-18. Several methods have been renamed due to misspellings.  The old
-    methods have been deprecated and will be removed before the 1.0
-    release.
-
-
-Release 0.6
-
- 1. Added clustering-carrot2 plugin, together with introduction of clustering
-    api and modification to search jsp. (Dawid Weiss via John Xing, 20040809)
-
- 2. Make a number of changes to NDFS (Nutch Distributed File System)
-    to fix bugs, add admin tools, etc.
-
-    Also, modify all command line tools so you can indicate whether to
-    use NDFS or the local filesystem.  If you indicate nothing, then
-    it defaults to the local fs.
-
-    I've used this to do a 35m page crawl via NDFS, distributed over a
-    dozen machines.  (Mike Cafarella)
-
- 3. Add support for BASE tags in HTML.  Outlinks are now correctly
-    extracted when a BASE tag is present.  (cutting)
-
- 4. Fix two bugs in result pagination.  When the last hit on a page
-    was the last hit overall, the "next" button was sometimes shown
-    when the "show all" button should be shown instead.  Also, in
-    certain cases, the "show all" button would be shown when the
-    "next" button should have been shown.  (cutting)
-
- 5. Add config parameter "indexer.max.tokens" that determines the
-    maximum number of tokens indexed per field.  (Andy Hedges via cutting)
-
- 6. Add parser for mp3 files.  (Andy Hedges via cutting)
-
- 7. Add RegexUrlNormalizer.  This is useful for things like stripping
-    out session IDs from URLs.  To use it, add values for
-    urlnormalizer.class and urlnormalizer.regex.file to your
-    nutch-site.xml.  The RegexUrlNormalizer class extends the
-    BasicUrlNormalizer, and does basic normalization as well.
-    (Luke Baker via cutting)
-
- 8. Added Swedish translation (Stefan Verzel via Sami Siren, 20040910)
-
- 9. Added Polish translation (Andrzej Bialecki, 20040911)
- 
-10. Added 3 more language profiles to language identifier (ru,hu,pl).
-	Other changes to language identifier: Porfiles converted to utf8,
-	added some test cases, changed the similarity calculation.
-	(Sami Siren, 20040925)
-
-11. Added plugin parse-rtf (Andy Hedges via John Xing, 20040929)
-
-12. Added plugin index-more and more.jsp (John Xing, 20041003)
-
-13. Added "View as Plain Text" feature. A new op OP_PARSETEXT is introduced
-    in DistributedSearch.java. text.jsp is added. (John Xing, 20041006)
-
-14. Fixed a bug that fails cached.jsp, explain.jsp, anchors.jsp and text.jsp
-    (but not search.jsp) with NullPointerException in distributed search.
-    It seems that this bug appears after "hits per site" stuff is added.
-    The fix is done in Hit.java, making sure String site is never null.
-    Hope this fix not have bad effetct on "hits per site" code.
-    (John Xing, 20041006)
-
-15. Fixed a bug that fails fullyDelete() in FileUtil.java for
-    LocalFileSystem.java. This bug also exposes possible incompleteness
-    of NDFSFile.java, where a few methods are not supported, including
-    delete(). Nothing changed in NDFSFile.java though. Leave it for future
-    improvement (John Xing, 20041022).
-
-16. Introduced option -noParsing to Fetcher.java and added ParseSegment.java.
-    A new status code CANT_PARSE is added to FetcherOutput.java.
-    Without option -noParsing , no change in fetcher behavior. With
-    option -noParsing, fetcher does crawls only, no parsing is carried out.
-    Then, ParseSegment.java should be used to parse in separate pass.
-    (John Xing, 20041025)
-
-17. Added ontology plugin. Currently it is used for query refinement, as
-    examplified in refine-query-init.jsp and refine-query.jsp. By default,
-    query refinement is disabled in search.jsp. Please check
-    ./src/plugin/ontology/README.txt for further description.
-    Ontology plugin certainly can be used for many other things.
-    (Michael J. Pan via John Xing, 20041129)
- 
-18. Changed fetcher.server.delay to be a float, so that sub-second
-    delays can be specified.  (cutting)
-
-19. Added plugin.includes config parameter that determines which
-    plugins are included.  By default now only http, html and basic
-    indexing and search plugins are enabled, rather than all plugins.
-    This should make default performance more predictable and reliable
-    going forward. (cutting)
-
-20. Cleaned up some filesystem code, including:
-
-    - Replaced BufferedRandomAccessFile with two simpler utilties,
-      NFSDataInputStream and NFSDataOutputStream.
-
-    - Fixed the bug where SequenceFiles were no longer flushed when
-      created, so that, when fetches crashed, segments were
-      unreadable.  Now segments are always readable after crashes.
-      Only the contents of the last buffer is lost.
-
-    - Simplified the FSOutputStream API to not include seek().  We
-      should never need that functionality.
-
-    - Simplified LocalFileSystem's implementations of FSInputStream
-      and FSOutputStream and optimized FSInputStream.seek().
-
-    (cutting)
-
-21. Fixed BasicUrlNormalizer to better handle relative urls.  The file
-    part of a URL is normalized in the following manner:
-
-      1. "/aa/../" will be replaced by "/" This is done step by step until
-	 the url doesnÂ´t change anymore. So we ensure, that
-	 "/aa/bb/../../" will be replaced by "/", too
-
-      2. leading "/../" will be replaced by "/"
-
-    (Sven Wende via cutting)
-
-22. Fix Page constructors so that next fetch date is less likely to be
-    misconstrued as a float.  This patches a problem in WebDBInjector,
-    where new pages were added to the db with nextScore set to the
-    intended nextFetch date.  This, in turn, confused link analysis.
-
-23. In ndfs code, replace addLocalFile(), putToLocalFile() with
-    copyFromLocalFile(), moveFromLocalFile(), copyToLocalFile() and
-    moveToLocalFile(). (John Xing, 20041217)
-
-24. Added new config parameter fetcher.threads.per.host.  This is used
-    by the Http protocol.  When this is one behavior is as before.
-    When this is greater than one then multiple threads are permitted
-    to access a host at once.  Note that fetcher.server.delay is no
-    longer consistently observed when this is greater than one.
-    (Luke Baker via Doug Cutting)
-
-Release 0.5
-
- 1. Changed plugin directory to be a list of directories.
-
- 2. Permit Plugin to be the default plugin implementation.
-
- 3. Added pluggable interface for network protocols in new package
-    net.nutch.protocol.  Moved http code from core into a plugin.
-
- 4. Added pluggable interface for content parsing in new package
-    net.nutch.parse.  Moved html parsing code from core into a
-    plugin.
-
- 5. Fixed a bug in NutchAnalysis where 16-bit characters were not
-    processed correctly.
-
- 6. Fixed bug #971731: random summaries on result page.
-    (Daniel Naber via cutting)
-
- 7. Made Nutch logo transparent. (Daniel Naber via cutting)
-
- 8. Added file protocol plugin.  (John Xing via cutting)
-
- 9. Added ftp protocol plugin.  (John Xing via cutting)
-
-10. Added pdf and msword parser plugins.  (John Xing via cutting)
-
-11. Added pluggable indexing interface.  By default, url, content,
-    anchors and title are indexed, as before, but now one can easily
-    alter this to, e.g., index metadata.  A demonstration is provided
-    which extracts and indexes Creative Commons license urls. (cutting)
-
-12. Add language identification plugin. 
-
-    The process of identification is as follows:
-
-    1. html (html only, HTML 4.0 "lang" attribute)
-    2. meta tags (html only, http-equiv, dc.language)
-    3. http header (Content-Language)
-    4. if all above fail "statistical analysis"
-
-    1 & 2 are run during the fetching phase and 3 & 4 are run on
-    indexing phase.
-
-    Currently supported languages (in "statistical analysis") are
-    da,de,el,en,es,fi,fr,it,nl,sv and pt. The corpus used was grabbed
-    from http://www.isi.edu/~koehn/europarl/ and the profiles were
-    build with tool supplied in patch.
-
-    After indexing the language can be found from field named "lang"
-
-    It's not 100% accurate but it's a start.
-    (Sami Siren)
-
-13. Added SegmentMergeTool and "mergesegs" command, to remove
-    duplicated or otherwise not used content from several segments and
-    joining them together into a single new segment.  The tool also
-    optionally performs several other steps required for proper
-    operation of Nutch - such as indexing segments, deleting
-    duplicates, merging indices, and indexing the new single segment.
-    (Andrzej Bialecki)
-
-14. Add the ability to retrieve ParseData of a search hit. ParseData
-    contains many valuable properties of a search hit.
-
-    This is required (among others) to properly display the cached
-    content because it's not possible to determine the character
-    encoding from the output of the getContent() method (which returns
-    byte[]). The symptoms are that for HTML pages using non-latin1 or
-    non-UTF8 encodings the cached preview will almost certainly look
-    broken. Using the attached patch it is possible to determine the
-    character encoding from the ParseData (for HTTP: Content-Type
-    metadata), and encode the content accordingly. (Andrzej Bialecki)
-
-15. Add a pluggable query interface.  By default, the content, anchor
-    and url fields are searched as before.  A sample plugin indexes
-    the host name and adds a "site:" keyword to query parsing.
-
-16. Added support for "lang:" in queries.  For example, searching with
-    "lang:en" restricts results to pages which were identified to
-    be in English.
-
-17. Automatically optimize field queries to use cached Lucene filters.
-    This makes, for example, searches restricted by languages or sites
-    that are very common much faster.
-
-18. Improved charset handling in jsp pages.  (jshin by cutting)
-
-19. Permit topic filtering when injecting DMOZ pages.  (jshin by cutting)
-
-20. When parsing crawled pages, interpret charset specifications in
-    html meta tags.  (jshin by cutting)
-
-21. Added support for "cc:licensed" in queries, which searches for documents
-    released under Creative Commons licenses.  Attributes of the
-    license may also be queried, with, e.g., "cc:by" for
-    attribution-required licenses, "cc:nc" for non-commercial
-    licenses, etc.
-
-22. Relative paths named in plugin.folders are now searched for on the
-    classpath.  This makes, e.g., deployment in a war file much simpler.
-
-23. Modifications to Fetcher.java.
-
-    1. Make sure it works properly with regard to creation and initialization
-    of plugin instances. The problem was that multiple threads race to
-    startUp() or shutDown() plugin instances. It was solved by synchronizing
-    certain codes in PluginRepository.java and Extension.java.
-    (Stefan Groschupf via John Xing)
-
-    2. Added code to explictly shutDown() plugins. Otherwise FetcherThreads
-    may never return (quit) if there are still data or other structures
-    (e.g., persistent socket connections) associated with plugins. (John Xing)
-    
-    3. Fixed one type of Fetcher "hang" problems by monitoring named
-    FetcherThreads. If all FetcherThreads are gone (finished),
-    Fetcher.java is considered done. The problem was: there could be
-    runaway threads started by external libs via FetcherThreads.
-    Those threads never return, thus keep Fetcher from exiting normally.
-    (John Xing)
-
-24. Eliminate excessive hits from sites.  This is done efficiently by
-    adding the site name to Hit instances, and, when needed,
-    re-querying with too-frequent sites prohibited in the query.
-
-
-Release 0.4
-
- 1. Http class refactored.  (Kevin Smith via Tom Pierce)
-
- 2. Add Finnish translation. (Sampo Syreeni via Doug Cutting)
-
- 3. Added Japanese translation. (Yukio Andoh via Doug Cutting)
-
- 4. Updated Dutch translation. (Ype Kingma via Doug Cutting)
-
- 5. Initial version of Distributed DB code.  (Mike Cafarella)
-
- 6. Make things more tolerant of crashed fetcher output files.
-    (Doug Cutting)
-
- 7. New skin for website. (Frank Henze via Doug Cutting)
-
- 8. Added Spanish translation. (Diego Basch via Doug Cutting)
-
- 9. Add FTP support to fetcher.  (John Xing via Doug Cutting)
-
-10. Added Thai translation. (Pichai Ongvasith via Doug Cutting)
-
-11. Added Robots.txt & throttling support to Fetcher.java.  (Mike
-    Cafarella)
-
-12. Added nightly build. (Doug Cutting)
-
-13. Default all link scores to 1.0. (Doug Cutting)
-
-14. Permit one to keep internal links. (Doug Cutting)
-
-15. Fixed dedup to select shortest URL. (Doug Cutting)
-
-16. Changed index merger so that merged index is written to named
-    directory, rather than to a generated name in that directory.
-    (Doug Cutting)
-
-17. Disable coordination weighting of query clauses and other minor
-    scoring improvements. (Doug Cutting)
-
-18. Added a new command, crawl, that constructs a database, injects a
-    url file and performs a few rounds of generate/fetch/updatedb.
-    This simplifies use for intranet sites.  Changed some defaults to
-    be more intranet friendly.  (Doug Cutting)
-
-19. Fixed a bug where Fetcher.java didn't construct correct relative
-    links when a page was redirected.  (Doug Cutting)
-
-20. Fixed a query parser problem with lookahead over plusses and minuses.
-    (Doug Cutting)
-
-21. Add support for HTTP proxy servers.  (Sami Siren via Doug Cutting)
-
-22. Permit searching while fetching and/or indexing.
-    (Sami Siren via Doug Cutting)
-
-23. Fix a bug when throttling is disabled.  (Sami Siren via Doug Cutting)
-
-24. Updated Bahasa Malaysia translation.  (Michael Lim via Doug Cutting)
-
-25. Added Catalan translation.  (Xavier Guardiola via Doug Cutting)
-
-26. Added brazilian portuguese translation.
-    (A. Moreir via Doug Cutting)
-
-27. Added a french translation.  (Julien Nioche via Doug Cutting)
-
-28. Updated to Lucene 1.4RC3.  (Doug Cutting)
-
-29. Add capability to boost by link count & use it in crawl tool.
-    (Doug Cutting)
-
-30. Added plugin system.  (Stefan Groschupf via Doug Cutting)
-
-31. Add this change log file, for recording significant changes to
-    Nutch.  Populate it with changes from the last few months.

-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-          stating that You changed the files; and
-
-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-

-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

- *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
- *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

- *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
- *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

- *      the conditions stated in this License.
- *
- *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

- *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
- *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

- *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
- *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
- *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
- *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
- *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
- *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
- *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
- *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
- *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
- *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

- *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

-      as of the date such litigation is filed.

-          as modifying the License.

-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

-License.
-
-4.2. Effect of New Versions.
-
-You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered

-License published by the license steward.  4.3. Modified Versions.
-
-When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
-Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if
-You: (a)árename the license and remove any references to the name of the
-license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License);
-and (b)áotherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ
-from this License.

-==========================================================================
-The following license applies to JUnit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Common Public License - v 1.0
-
-THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-
-1. DEFINITIONS
-
-"Contribution" means:
-
-      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
-      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-
-      i) changes to the Program, and
-
-      ii) additions to the Program;
-
-      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. 
-
-"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-
-"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
-
-"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-
-"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
-
-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-
-      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
-
-      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. 
-
-      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
-
-      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. 
-
-3. REQUIREMENTS
-
-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
-
-      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-
-      b) its license agreement:
-
-      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; 
-
-      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; 
-
-      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-
-      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
-
-When the Program is made available in source code form:
-
-      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
-
-      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
-
-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
-
-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
-
-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-
-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
-
-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
-
-5. NO WARRANTY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-
-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. GENERAL
-
-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
-
-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
-
-Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
-
-This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-
-Common Public License Version 1.0
-
-THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
-
-1. DEFINITIONS
-
-"Contribution" means:
-
-    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
-
-    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
-
-    i) changes to the Program, and
-
-    ii) additions to the Program;
-
-    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
-
-"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
-
-"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
-
-"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
-
-"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
-
-2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
-
-    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
-
-    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
-
-    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
-
-    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
-
-3. REQUIREMENTS
-
-A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
-
-    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
-
-    b) its license agreement:
-
-    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
-
-    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Cntributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
-
-    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
-
-    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
-
-When the Program is made available in source code form:
-
-    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
-
-    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. 
-
-Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
-
-Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
-
-4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
-
-Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
-
-For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
-
-5. NO WARRANTY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
-
-6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
-
-EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PR LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-7. GENERAL
-
-If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
-
-If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

-
-All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.

-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-          stating that You changed the files; and
-
-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
-      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
-      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

-          the Derivative Works; and

-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

-
-      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
-      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
-      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
-      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
-      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

-      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
-      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
-      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
-      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
-      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-
-   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

-      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
-      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
-      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
-      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
-      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
-      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
-      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
-      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
-      as of the date such litigation is filed.
-
-   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
-      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
-      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
-      meet the following conditions:
-
-      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
-          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-
-      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
-          stating that You changed the files; and
-
-      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
-          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
-          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
-          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
-          the Derivative Works; and
-
-      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
-          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
-          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
-          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
-          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
-          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
-          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
-          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
-          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
-          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
-          as modifying the License.
-
-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
-      the conditions stated in this License.
-
-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-
-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-
-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
-      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
-      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
-      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
-      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
-      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
-      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
-      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
-      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-
-   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-
-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-
-   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

-  Description: This document contains top level domains 
-  as described by the Internet Assigned Numbers
-  Authotiry (IANA), and second or third level domains that 
-  are known to be managed by domain registerers. People at 
-  Mozilla community call these public suffixes or effective 
-  tlds. There is no algorithmic way of knowing whether a suffix 
-  is a public domain suffix, or not. So this large file is used 
-  for this purpose. The entries in the file is used to find the
-  domain of a url, which may not the same thing as the host of 
-  the url. For example for "http://lucene.apache.org/nutch" the 
-  hostname is lucene.apache.org, however the domain name for this
-  url would be apache.org. Domain names can be quite handy for 
-  statistical analysis, and fighting against spam.    
-  
-  The list of TLDs is constructed from IANA, and the 
-  list of "effective tlds" are constructed from Wikipedia, 
-  http://wiki.mozilla.org/TLD_List, and http://publicsuffix.org/
-  The list may not include all the suffixes, but some
-  effort has been spent to make it comprehensive. Please forward 
-  any improvements for this list to nutch-dev mailing list, or 
-  nutch JIRA. 
-  
-  Top level domains(tlds) are grouped
-  to three, namely infrastrusture, generic and country 
-  code tlds. Infrastrusture tlds are only used for 
-  technical reasons. Generic tlds represents the type 
-  of the organization that they represent. Those in 
-  current use and those waiting for approval is listed.
-  Most of the country code tlds correspond to the two 
-  letter ISO-3166-1 country codes. 
-  Each tld is listed with its domain (such as com), a 
-  status enumeration describing the status of the tld, 
-  and optionally a description or description for convenience.
-  cctlds are listed with additional country name field.
-  
-  status and boost elements are optional, with default values IN_USE 
-  and 1.0 respectively. see domain-suffixes.xsd for the xml schema.

-          (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.root)
-          vrsn-end-of-zone-marker-dummy-record.root is a domain name
-          listed in the DNS root zone as a diagnostic marker, whose
-          presence demonstrates the root zone was not truncated upon
-          loading by a root nameserver. It could be argued it represents
-          a top-level domain of .root, although technically no such
-          delegation exists.

-          (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.arpa) .arpa is an Internet
-          top-level domain (TLD) used exclusively for
-          Internet-infrastructure purposes. It does not function as a
-          normal TLD where websites are registered, but rather as a
-          meta-TLD used to look up addresses, and for other purposes.

-  This is the authentication configuration file for protocol-httpclient.
-  Different credentials for different authentication scopes can be
-  configured in this file. If a set of credentials is configured for a 
-  particular authentication scope (i.e. particular host, port number,
-  scheme and realm), then that set of credentials would be sent only to
-  servers falling under the specified authentication scope. Apart from
-  this at most one set of credentials can be configured as 'default'.
-  
-  When authentication is required to fetch a resource from a web-server,
-  the authentication-scope is determined from the host, port, scheme and
-  realm (if present) obtained from the URL of the page and the
-  authentication headers in the HTTP response. If it matches any
-  'authscope' in this configuration file, then the 'credentials' for
-  that 'authscope' is used for authentication. Otherwise, it would use
-  the 'default' set of credentials (with an exception which is described
-  in the next paragraph), if present. If any attribute is missing, it
-  would match all values for that attribute.
-
-  If there are several pages having different authentication realms and
-  schemes on the same web-server (same host and port, but different
-  realms and schemes), and credentials for one or more of the realms and
-  schemes for that web-server is specified, then the 'default'
-  credentials would be ignored completely for that web-server (for that
-  host and port). So, credentials to handle all realms and schemes for
-  that server may be specified explicitly by adding an extra 'authscope'
-  tag with the 'realm' and 'scheme' attributes missing for that server.
-  This is demonstrated by the last 'authscope' tag for 'example:8080' in
-  the following example.
-
-  Example:-
-    <credentials username="susam" password="masus">
-      <default realm="sso"/>
-      <authscope host="192.168.101.33" port="80" realm="login"/>
-      <authscope host="example" port="8080" realm="blogs"/>
-      <authscope host="example" port="8080" realm="wiki"/>
-      <authscope host="example" port="80" realm="quiz" scheme="NTLM"/>
-    </credentials>
-    <credentials username="admin" password="nimda">
-      <authscope host="example" port="8080"/>
-    </credentials>
-
-  In the above example, 'example:8080' server has pages with multiple
-  authentication realms. The first set of credentials would be used for
-  'blogs' and 'wiki' authentication realms. The second set of
-  credentials would be used for all other realms. For 'login' realm of
-  '192.168.101.33', the first set of credentials would be used. For any
-  other realm of '192.168.101.33' authentication would not be done. For
-  the NTLM authentication required by 'example:80', the first set of
-  credentials would be used. For 'sso' realms of all other servers, the
-  first set of credentials would be used, since it is configured as
-  'default'.
-
-  NTLM does not use the notion of realms. The domain name may be
-  specified as the value for 'realm' attribute in case of NTLM.
-
- More information on Basic, Digest and NTLM authentication
- support can be located at https://wiki.apache.org/nutch/HttpAuthenticationSchemes
-
- HTTP-POST Authentication Support
- Http Form-based Authentication is a very common used authentication 
- mechanism to protect web resources. We extend the 'auth-configuration' 
- to include information about http form authentication properties as shown
- in the following example:
-
- Example:-
-   <credentials authMethod="formAuth"
-                loginUrl="http://localhost:44444/Account/Login.aspx"
-                loginFormId="ctl01"
-                loginRedirect="true">
-     <loginPostData>
-       <field name="ctl00$MainContent$LoginUser$UserName"
-              value="admin"/>
-       <field name="ctl00$MainContent$LoginUser$Password"
-              value="admin123"/>
-     </loginPostData>
-     <additionalPostHeaders>
-       <field name="User-Agent"
-              value="Mozilla/5.0 ... Firefox/35.0" />
-     </additionalPostHeaders>
-     <removedFormFields>
-       <field name="ctl00$MainContent$LoginUser$RememberMe"/>
-     </removedFormFields>
-     <loginCookie>
-       <policy>BROWSER_COMPATIBILITY</policy>
-     </loginCookie>
-   </credentials>
- 
- it is critical that the following fields are substituted:
-  * loginUrl - the URL containing the actual <form>
-  * loginFormId - the <form id="$formId" attribute value
-    (or the 'name' attribute if no form is referenced by 'id' attribute)
-  * loginRedirect - if http post login returns redirect code: 301 or 302,
-    and value is true, Http Client will automatically follow the redirect.
-  * <field name="ctl00$MainContent$LoginUser$UserName" value="admin"
-    - the <input name"name" and user defined username value used to represent
-    the field and username respectively
-  * <field name="ctl00$MainContent$LoginUser$Password" value="admin123"
-    - the <input name"name" and user defined password value used to represent
-    the field and password respectively
-  * <field name="ctl00$MainContent$LoginUser$RememberMe"/>
-    - form element attributes for which we wish to skip fields
-  * <policy> value from <loginCookie> is a constant value symbol from 
-    org.apache.commons.httpclient.cookie.CookiePolicy, like BROWSER_COMPATIBILITY,
-    DEFAULT, RFC_2109, etc.

-
-<property>
-  <name>store.ip.address</name>
-  <value>false</value>
-  <description>Enables us to capture the specific IP address 
-  (InetSocketAddress) of the host which we connect to via 
-  the given protocol. Currently supported is protocol-ftp and
-  http.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<!-- file properties -->
-
-<property>
-  <name>file.content.limit</name>
-  <value>1048576</value>
-  <description>The length limit for downloaded content using the file://
-  protocol, in bytes. If this value is nonnegative (>=0), content longer
-  than it will be truncated; otherwise, no truncation at all. Do not
-  confuse this setting with the http.content.limit setting.
-  </description>
-</property>
-  
-<property>
-  <name>file.crawl.parent</name>
-  <value>true</value>
-  <description>The crawler is not restricted to the directories that you specified in the
-    Urls file but it is jumping into the parent directories as well. For your own crawlings you can
-    change this behavior (set to false) the way that only directories beneath the directories that you specify get
-    crawled.</description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>file.crawl.redirect_noncanonical</name>
-  <value>true</value>
-  <description>
-    If true, protocol-file treats non-canonical file names as
-    redirects and does not canonicalize file names internally. A file
-    name containing symbolic links as path elements is then not
-    resolved and &quot;fetched&quot; but recorded as redirect with the
-    canonical name (all links on path are resolved) as redirect
-    target.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>file.content.ignored</name>
-  <value>true</value>
-  <description>If true, no file content will be saved during fetch.
-  And it is probably what we want to set most of time, since file:// URLs
-  are meant to be local and we can always use them directly at parsing
-  and indexing stages. Otherwise file contents will be saved.
-  !! NO IMPLEMENTED YET !!
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<!-- HTTP properties -->
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.agent.name</name>
-  <value></value>
-  <description>HTTP 'User-Agent' request header. MUST NOT be empty - 
-  please set this to a single word uniquely related to your organization.
-
-  NOTE: You should also check other related properties:
-
-    http.robots.agents
-    http.agent.description
-    http.agent.url
-    http.agent.email
-    http.agent.version
-
-  and set their values appropriately.
-
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.robots.agents</name>
-  <value></value>
-  <description>Any other agents, apart from 'http.agent.name', that the robots
-  parser would look for in robots.txt. Multiple agents can be provided using 
-  comma as a delimiter. eg. mybot,foo-spider,bar-crawler
-  
-  The ordering of agents does NOT matter and the robots parser would make 
-  decision based on the agent which matches first to the robots rules.  
-  Also, there is NO need to add a wildcard (ie. "*") to this string as the 
-  robots parser would smartly take care of a no-match situation. 
-    
-  If no value is specified, by default HTTP agent (ie. 'http.agent.name') 
-  would be used for user agent matching by the robots parser. 
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.robot.rules.whitelist</name>
-  <value></value>
-  <description>Comma separated list of hostnames or IP addresses to ignore 
-  robot rules parsing for. Use with care and only if you are explicitly
-  allowed by the site owner to ignore the site's robots.txt!
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.robots.403.allow</name>
-  <value>true</value>
-  <description>Some servers return HTTP status 403 (Forbidden) if
-  /robots.txt doesn't exist. This should probably mean that we are
-  allowed to crawl the site nonetheless. If this is set to false,
-  then such sites will be treated as forbidden.</description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.agent.description</name>
-  <value></value>
-  <description>Further description of our bot- this text is used in
-  the User-Agent header.  It appears in parenthesis after the agent name.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.agent.url</name>
-  <value></value>
-  <description>A URL to advertise in the User-Agent header.  This will 
-   appear in parenthesis after the agent name. Custom dictates that this
-   should be a URL of a page explaining the purpose and behavior of this
-   crawler.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.agent.email</name>
-  <value></value>
-  <description>An email address to advertise in the HTTP 'From' request
-   header and User-Agent header. A good practice is to mangle this
-   address (e.g. 'info at example dot com') to avoid spamming.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.agent.version</name>
-  <value>Nutch-1.16</value>
-  <description>A version string to advertise in the User-Agent 
-   header.</description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.agent.rotate</name>
-  <value>false</value>
-  <description>
-    If true, instead of http.agent.name, alternating agent names are
-    chosen from a list provided via http.agent.rotate.file.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.agent.rotate.file</name>
-  <value>agents.txt</value>
-  <description>
-    File containing alternative user agent names to be used instead of
-    http.agent.name on a rotating basis if http.agent.rotate is true.
-    Each line of the file should contain exactly one agent
-    specification including name, version, description, URL, etc.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.agent.host.cookie.file</name>
-  <value>cookies.txt</value>
-  <description>
-    File containing per-host configured cookies.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.agent.host</name>
-  <value></value>
-  <description>Name or IP address of the host on which the Nutch crawler
-  would be running. Currently this is used by 'protocol-httpclient'
-  plugin.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.timeout</name>
-  <value>10000</value>
-  <description>The default network timeout, in milliseconds.</description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.content.limit</name>
-  <value>1048576</value>
-  <description>The length limit for downloaded content using the http/https
-  protocols, in bytes. If this value is nonnegative (>=0), content longer
-  than it will be truncated; otherwise, no truncation at all. Do not
-  confuse this setting with the file.content.limit setting.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.time.limit</name>
-  <value>-1</value>
-  <description>The time limit in seconds to fetch a single document.
-  If this value is nonnegative (>=0), the HTTP protocol implementation
-  will stop reading from a socket after http.time.limit seconds have
-  been spent for fetching this document.  The HTTP response is then
-  marked as truncated.  The http.time.limit should be set to a longer
-  time period than http.timeout, as it applies to the entire duration
-  to fetch a document, not only the network timeout of a single I/O
-  operation.  Note: supported only by protocol-okhttp.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.partial.truncated</name>
-  <value>false</value>
-  <description>
-    If true the HTTP protocol implementation may store the content of
-    partial fetches and mark the response as truncated instead of
-    throwing an exception which will cause the fetch to fail.  This
-    allows to use the data which has already been fetched, instead of
-    retrying the fetch later.  Note: supported only by protocol-okhttp.
-  </description>
-</property>
-
-<property>
-  <name>http.tls.certificates.check</name>
-  <value>false</value>
-  <description>
-    Whether to check the TLS/SSL server certificates for validity.
-    If true invalid (e.g., self-signed or expired) certificates are
-    rejected and the https connection is failed.  If false insecure
-    TLS/SSL connections are allowed.  Note that this property is
-    currently not supported by all http/https protocol plugins.

-  and follow until the desired depth is reached. A value of 1 means all generated pages are fetched and their first degree
-  outlinks are fetched and parsed too. Be careful, this feature is in itself agnostic of the state of the CrawlDB and does not
-  know about already fetched pages. A setting larger than 2 will most likely fetch home pages twice in the same fetch cycle.
-  It is highly recommended to set db.ignore.external.links to true to restrict the outlink follower to URL's within the same
-  domain. When disabled (false) the feature is likely to follow duplicates even when depth=1.
-  A value of -1 of 0 disables this feature.

- ! declarations of any new extension points being introduced by the plug-in,
- ! as well as configuration of functional extensions
- ! (configured into extension points defined by other plug-ins,

-<!-- A user displayable name for the plug-in -->
-<!ATTLIST plugin name CDATA #REQUIRED>
-
-<!-- 
- ! A unique identifier for the plug-in.
- ! To minimize potential for naming collisions,
- ! the identifier should be derived from the internet domain id
- ! of the supplying provider (reversing the domain name tokens and
- ! appending additional name tokens separated by dot [.]).
- ! For example, provider nutch.org could define plug-in identifier
- ! org.nutch.myplugin
- !-->
-<!ATTLIST plugin id CDATA #REQUIRED>
-
-<!--
- ! The plug-in version number.
- ! NOTE : Version numbers compatibility are not yet implemented.

-<!ATTLIST plugin provider-name CDATA #IMPLIED>
-
-<!--
- ! The name of the plug-in class for this plug-in.
- ! The class must be a subclass of org.apache.nutch.plugin.Plugin

-<!-- 
- ! The <requires> section of the manifest declares
- ! any dependencies on other plug-ins.

-<!--
- ! The <runtime> section of the manifest contains a definition of one or more

- ! The referenced libraries are used by the plugin execution mechanisms
- ! (the plug-in class loader) to load and execute the correct code required by
- ! the plug-in.

-
-<!--
- ! Each <library> element can specify which portion
- ! of the library should be exported.
- ! The export rules are specified as a set of export masks.
- ! By default (no export rules specified),
- ! the library is considered to be private.
- ! Each export mask is specified using the name attribute.
- !-->
-<!ELEMENT export EMPTY>
-
-<!--
- ! The export mask can have the following values:
- !   * - indicates all contents of library are exported (public)
- !   package.name.* - indicates all classes in the specified package

- ! Nutch's architecture is based on the notion of configurable extension points.
- ! Nutch itself predefines a set of extension points that cover the task of
- ! extending it (for example, adding parser, indexing filter, ...).
- ! In addition to the predefined extension points, each supplied plug-in can
- ! declare additional extension points. By declaring an extension point the
- ! plug-in is essentially advertising the ability to configure the plug-in
- ! function with externally supplied extensions.

-This is a placeholder to put Hadoop native libraries -it's a component
-that contains platform-specific native code that significantly speeds up
-data (de)compression. Since there are no maven artifacts for this component
-the build process can't automatically download it.
-
-These libraries are purely optional, and if they are missing Hadoop will
-use corresponding pure Java components. The impact of native compression
-becomes noticeable with larger datasets and weaker CPU-s - if you notice
-that the CPU is routinely saturated when a job is sorting or reducing,
-then using these libs may help.
-
-Installation instructions
-=========================
-You can obtain the necessary files from a distribution package of Hadoop,
-e.g. hadoop-0.20.2.tar.gz. Unpack this archive, and copy the content of
-lib/native here, so that the layout looks like this:
-
-<Nutch home>/lib/native/Linux-amd64-64/...
-<Nutch home>/lib/native/Linux-i386-32/...
-
-Local runtime
--------------
-The build process will include these native libraries when preparing
-the /runtime/local environment for running in local mode.
-
-/runtime/local/bin/nutch knows how to use these libs - if they are
-found and correctly used that's fine, however if they are not and you
-see WARN, don't worry, however you will see lines like this in your logs:
-
-15:36:02,126 WARN org.apache.hadoop.util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load
-native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where
-applicable
-...
-probably quite a few more of the same
-...
-
-Distributed runtime
--------------------
-If you want to use this component in an existing Hadoop cluster (when using
-/runtime/deploy artifacts) you need to make sure these files are placed in
-Hadoop/lib/native directory on each node, and then restart the cluster. If
-you installed the cluster from a distribution package of Hadoop then these
-libraries should already be in the right place and you shouldn't need to do
-anything else.
